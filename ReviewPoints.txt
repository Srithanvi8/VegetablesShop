    controller
    model
    config
    exceptions
    dto
        requestDTO
        responseDTO
    dao
        impl
        repo
    service

5. Make use of lombok instead of writing more code-- refer generic response dto
    settings->plugins->marketplace->search lombok-> install-->restart
    -->add corresponding dependencies --- done
6. need exception handling  --- done
7. Response-- follow generic response
    each api response should be
    {
      "status": true,
      "message": "Request processed successfully",
      "timestamp": "2025-03-05T00:01:00Z",
      "result": {}
    }
    result will be actual data  --- done
8. comments missing-- refer java doc
9. schema specification missing in table annotation  --- done
10. ** code is tight coupled--
    --response should be different class and entity should be different class
    --use mapper for data mapping(modelmapper)
